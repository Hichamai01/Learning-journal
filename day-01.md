### Day 01 - Python Basics

## 🧠 Knowledge Acquired


- I wrote my first program.

- I used the `print()` function.

- The text between the quotation marks is a string.

- Python is case-sensitive.

- Indentation is important.

- Incorrect indentation causes an error.

- I learned the trick of repeating text using `*`



## 💻 Code Snippet

```python
if True:
    print("I LOVE PYTHON")

print("I LOVE PYTHON"*6)
```



## ⚠️ Issues & Solutions

- I got an `IndentationError`.
  → I fixed it by aligning the code correctly.

- I typed `Print` instead of `print` and got a `NameError`.
  → I changed it to lowercase and the code worked.



## 🏆 HackerRank Challenge

### Challenge Name: Say "Hello, World!" With Python

What the challenge asked:
- Print `Hello, World!`.

What I learned:
- How to use `print()` correctly.
- How to write a text in Python.

My solution:

HackerRank provided this template:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Hello, World!")

At first, I was confused.

After testing, I realized the challenge only needed:

print("Hello, World!")
